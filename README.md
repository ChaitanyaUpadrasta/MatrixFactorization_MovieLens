# MatrixFactorization_MovieLens
Identifying audience for a targeted email campaign using Matrix Factorization.
This project was a part of Recommender Systems course and the task was to identify 18-34 year old women for targeted email campaign.
Datasets: with demographics: MovieLens 1M and without demographics: MovieLens 20M.
Need to learn to identify target group from 1M to identify candidates in 20M.
